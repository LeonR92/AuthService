# Scalable Authentication Service Architecture
## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Describe the overall purpose of the authentication service.
- **Scope**: Outline what this document will cover and any limitations.
- **Definitions and Acronyms**: Provide definitions for any specific terms and acronyms used.
## 2. System Overview
- **Architecture Diagram**: Include a high-level diagram of the system architecture.
- **Nodes (Components)**: 
    - **Client (User)**: Represents external users interacting with the system.
    - **Nginx (Load Balancer)**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the authentication service.
    - **Authentication Service (Flask/FastAPI)**: Core service handling login, signup, MFA, and session management.
    - **Redis (Caching Layer)**: Stores session tokens and improves response times for frequently requested data.
    - **HAProxy (Load Balancer for DB Reads)**: Distributes read queries among read replicas.
    - **PGBouncer (Connection Pooler)**: Manages database connections efficiently to prevent overload.
    - **PostgreSQL (Primary Database)**: Stores user accounts, authentication logs, and MFA details.
    - **PostgreSQL Read Replicas (x3)**: Replicated databases to scale read operations.
- **Connections (Arrows and Labels)**:
    - Client → Nginx → "Incoming HTTP Requests"
    - Nginx → Authentication Service → "API Calls (Login, Register, MFA, etc.)"
    - Authentication Service → Redis → "Session & Token Caching"
    - Authentication Service → HAProxy → "DB Read Requests"
    - HAProxy → PGBouncer → "Optimized DB Connections"
    - PGBouncer → PostgreSQL (Primary) → "Write Transactions"
    - PostgreSQL (Primary) → PostgreSQL Replicas → "Data Replication for Read Scaling"
## 3. Functional Requirements
- **User login and registration**
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- **Session management**
## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**
- **Security**
- **Performance**
- **Availability and fault tolerance**
## 5. Protocols
- **Supported Protocols**:
    - OAuth 2.0
## 6. Security Considerations
- **Rate limiting and protection against DDoS**
## 7. Observability
- **Tools and Practices**:
    - Prometheus for metrics
    - Grafana for dashboards
    - Centralized logging
## 8. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
- **Strategies**:
    - Load balancing across multiple servers
    - Database replication
    - Health checks and failover mechanisms
## 9. Testing and Validation
- **Strategies**:
    - Unit and integration testing
## 10. Deployment Plan
- **Steps for Deployment**: Outline the steps required to deploy the system in a production environment.
## 11. Maintenance and Support
- **Guidelines for Maintenance**: Provide details on how the system will be maintained and updated post-deployment.
- **Support Resources**: List the resources available for ongoing support.
## 12. Appendices
- **Additional Information**: Include any additional diagrams, references, or information that supports the document.
